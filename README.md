# 🏠 Housing Prices Analysis and Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the factors that influence housing prices and building a machine learning model to predict property values. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development using regression algorithms.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between key housing features and prices.  
- Build a predictive model to estimate housing prices.  
- Evaluate model performance and provide insights for better pricing decisions.

## 🧩 Dataset
The dataset includes details such as:
- Location  
- Square footage / area  
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- Amenities and neighborhood features  
- Price  

(You can replace this with your dataset source link, e.g., [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques))  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- *Programming Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- *Environment:* Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. *Data Collection* – Imported the dataset for analysis.  
2. *Data Preprocessing* – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized data.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Visualized data trends and correlations using plots.  
4. *Feature Engineering* – Selected the most important features for prediction.  
5. *Model Building* – Implemented and compared models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
6. *Model Evaluation* – Measured accuracy using R² Score, RMSE, and MAE.  
7. *Prediction* – Predicted housing prices based on trained models.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved a high R² score indicating accurate price prediction.  
- Identified key factors (e.g., area, location, number of rooms) affecting housing prices.  

## 🧠 Learnings
- Improved understanding of regression analysis and model evaluation.  
- Enhanced data visualization and feature engineering skills.  
- Gained experience in end-to-end machine learning project development.
